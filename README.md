Project Overview
This project aims to develop a predictive model for diabetes diagnosis using machine learning techniques. By leveraging a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, we analyze health data to determine the likelihood of a patient having diabetes. The goal is to provide an efficient tool for early detection, which can aid healthcare professionals in making informed decisions.

Model Implementation
The SVM model is chosen for its effectiveness in high-dimensional spaces and its ability to handle both linear and non-linear classification problems. The steps involved in the model implementation include:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, normalizing data, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
Model Training: Training the SVM model using the training dataset.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Results
The SVM model achieved a notable accuracy in predicting diabetes. The evaluation metrics demonstrate the model's capability to distinguish between diabetic and non-diabetic cases effectively. Detailed results can be found in the results section of the code.
